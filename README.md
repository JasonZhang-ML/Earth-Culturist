## Description:
In this game, a growing earth is under your protection. The earth is divided into 5 areas: city, forest, mountain, ocean and mainland. The earth is initially desolate (Fig. 1) and ready to reborn, however there’re many attacks from the universe falling to it. The global defense system is activated, you need to destroy the attack thing when it arrives the target area of earth’s atmosphere (target areas are thicker than atmosphere). The attack things will arrive the target area with the rhythms from background music.<br>

If the attack thing from any track crashes on the earth, the corresponding area (one of the 5 areas) will stops growing and move back to the previous stage (lose points). Similarly, if you destroy any attacks from the tracks, the corresponding area will grow (earn points). The broken area will start growing again even a crash happened on it, so keep protecting all areas. If you are playing well, a reburned earth will be presented (see an example in Fig. 2) with wild forest, prosperous city, dark blue ocean and cute creatures.<br>

Follow the rhythm, go get it and save this fantastic planet, make it reborn, enjoy!
